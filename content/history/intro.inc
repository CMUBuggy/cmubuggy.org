  <h3>The History of Buggy</h3>
  One of the Buggy Alumni Association's primary goals is to act as a repository for buggy history.
  Check out the links above to explore the historical information we have collected.<br />
  <br />
  We are hoping to finish a system to allow efficient contributions of new data and corrections sometime soon.  In the mean time, if you have something important to share, send an email to admin@cmubuggy.org.
