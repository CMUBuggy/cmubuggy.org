							Pittsburgh is covered in snow, but mechanics are already busy in their garages building new buggies while pushers work out in the gym because raceday is only 100 days away!  Here in the Buggy Alumni Association offices (read: the various offices of our employers), we're ramping up our efforts as well to make our second raceday our best.  Stop by the website and say hi!

							If you haven't been to <a href="http://cmubuggy.org/?utm_source=forum&utm_campaign=20100106">cmubuggy.org</a> this fall, there is a slew of new content to check out:
							<ul>
								<li>News - We've posted 16 news articles since September, most of which are accounts of the semester's freerolls.  Wondering how your old org is doing without you?</li>
								<li>Gallery - There are already 225 pictures from this year covering every team and buggy that has been out.</li>
								<li>What is Buggy? - When the freshmen got to campus this fall, we realized that we are in a great spot to introduce them to the sport.  We created a section on our site to briefly explain the sport we all love.  It's a work in progress, so feel free to suggest additions.</li>
								<li>Forums - Of course, buggy alumni are always up for banter.  This fall's conversations have hapazardly covered topics including a new timing system for raceday, Mazda's buggy-like prototype design, an entire thread covering memorably bad ideas in buggy construction, and who knows what else.  Join the fray!</li>
							</ul>
							Now is also the perfect time to let us know what you think we should be doing as an organization, or that you'd like to get more involved. Just reply to this e-mail!
