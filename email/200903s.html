							<span style="font-size:20px">Hello Buggy Fans!</span>
							Carnival 2009 is right around the corner (April 17 & 18th), and the Buggy Alumni Association has been busy since Homecoming preparing for it!   Over the last six months, over 170 people have become registered users on our website (<a href="http://cmubuggy.org?utm_source=s&utm_campaign=20090309">http://cmubuggy.org</a>) to see our updates on freeroll practices and to join the lively conversations in our forum.  Part of those discussions were about how the Buggy Alumni Association can make Raceday a better experience for everyone, and over 30 people have become dues paying members and made generous donations to support our efforts.   Now it's time for us to announce what we've got planned for Carnival.

						<td colspan="2" style="font-size:13px">cmuTV is eager to provide the best coverage they can on raceday, and they realized the best way to do that is to have buggy experts on the air with them.  Andy Bordick (PiKA '94) and Mark Estes (SN '87) will be on the air during the races broadcasting from the top of hill 2 and live from the chute. We're also helping to collect historical footage cmuTV can use in the time between heats.  In addition, we're working with cmuTV and WRCT to make sure the cmuTV audio is being played in the chute for everyone to hear.</td>
