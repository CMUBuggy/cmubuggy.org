					Lead Truck Auction</a> Auction starts Tomorrow at 9am and runs until 9pm Wednesday<br />
					For the third year, Sweepstakes has given us the opportunity to raise funds for the Buggy Alumni Association by auctioning off the chance to ride in the lead truck during live races. Auction winners get to ride in the bed of the pickup truck with the head judge, Sweepstakes chairman, and other race officials. The first $1,000 from the auction go directly to help pay for the dual jumbotrons on the course. Join in on the fun and help us make our #1 fundraiser a success again this year!

					Our members-only raceday preview provides all the background you need to be prepared for this year's races. We cover the progress and struggles team by team, as well as top issues so that you know what's going on this raceday. It's about 100x as good as compubookie this year, you're going to want to have a copy.<br /> 
					2011 Members are also cordially invited to the Raceday Reception after prelims on Friday.  We've simplified the membership system and now a gift of any size at all will make you a member!

					Check out our all-new website</a><br />
					We finished up our months-long project renovating cmubuggy.org just in time for raceday, and if you haven't checked it out yet, you need to.  The biggest new feature is a library of videos including all cmuTV coverage for the last 8 years and a collection of other footage.  A new wiki-style reference section, and improved history database promise to help organize and preserve buggy information.  Last but not least, a content feed on the homepage tells you exactly where to look for the freshest content.
