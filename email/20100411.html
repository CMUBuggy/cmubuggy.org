							Truck weekend 2010 is officially in the books, which means we are less than 5 days away from Sweepstakes' 90th anniversary! Buggy alumni activity is peaking as well, and we wanted to keep you in the loop.  Our lead truck auction will close in 24 hours at 10pm Monday, our members-only Raceday Preview goes out tomorrow, and our schedule of carnival events is set.

							For the second year, Sweepstakes has given us the opportunity to raise funds for the Buggy Alumni Association again this year by auctioning off the chance to ride in the lead truck during live races. Auction winners get to ride in the bed of the pickup truck with the head judge, Sweepstakes chairman, and other race officials.  The auction is extra exciting this year for two reasons:
							<ul>
								<li><a style="color:#ee3940; text-decoration:none;" href="http://cmubuggy.org/news/2010/03/lead-truck-auction-2010-2-jumbotrons/?utm_source=forum&utm_campaign=20100411">The first $1,000 raised goes directly to help fund 2 jumbotrons on the course</a>.  You'll love watching the front hills from the chute for the first time.  Bid in the auction to help pay for the luxury.</li>
								<li><a style="color:#ee3940; text-decoration:none;" href="http://cmubuggy.org/news/2010/04/2000-matching-donation-for-the-baa/?utm_source=forum&utm_campaign=20100411">An anonymous donor has pledged to match every winning bid in the auction up to <b>$2,000!</b></a>  This could take us to new levels next year; please help us take advantage of this huge opportunity.  We're currently about half way there, so we need your help.  Bid now!</li>

							Our member's-only raceday preview provides all the background you need to be prepared for this year's races.  We cover the progress and struggles team by team, as well as issues like wheel development so that you know what's going on this raceday. Last year's issue had members saying:
							<ul>
								<li>"the sweetest thing that has ever come out for buggy ever"</li>
								<li>"who even needs compubookie now anyway?"</li>
								<li>"Balanced, nuanced, and - my God - Useful!"</li>					
							</ul>
							2010 Members also get:
								<li><b>Admission to the Raceday Reception after prelims on Friday</b></li>
								<li><b>Post-raceday wrap-up (by e-mail)</b> Coverage of the races by folks that have been there. We'll break down performances by each team and cover all of the action </li>
